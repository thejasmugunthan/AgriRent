# 🌾 AgriRent – Agricultural Equipment Rental Platform

AgriRent is a web-based application that helps farmers rent agricultural equipment easily while allowing equipment owners to earn by renting out their machines. Instead of spending a large amount of money on buying farming machinery, farmers can search, view, and rent equipment based on their needs. The platform connects farmers and equipment owners in one simple, user-friendly system with secure authentication and rental management.

## What the Project Does
AgriRent focuses on making agricultural equipment sharing simple and practical. Farmers can browse available equipment, check prices and availability, and place rental requests. Equipment owners can list their machines, manage availability, and track rental history. Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles, while the system securely stores user, equipment, and rental data. The main goal of this project is to reduce farming costs and improve access to modern agricultural tools using technology.
